  <h2>Basic Usage</h2>
  <p>
   Click <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Q3baWqE.png"/> to toggle the Overlay on and off. Once the Overlay is enabled, it should Just Workâ„¢ with little to no interaction from you. By default, it assumes your weapon has a range of 5 feet; shift-click the button to change it for your currently selected token. Normally the Overlay will reread your position at the end of your combat turn; control-click the button to force the Overlay to reposition. Display preferences are available in the module's Settings page.

  <p>
  The overlay in this image assumes a movement speed of 15ft/action and a weapon range of 10ft.<br/>
  1) Tiles tinted blue can be reached in a single action.<br/>
  2) Tiles tinted yellow can be reached in 2 actions.<br/>
  3) Enemies circled in white can be attacked without moving.<br/>
  4) Enemies circled in blue can be attacked in a single move.</br>
  5) Enemies circled in yellow can be attacked with 2 moves.<br/>
  6) Enemies circled in red require 3 or more movements to attack.<br/>
  7) All tokens (other than the selected token) in combat are annotated with their initiative order relative to the current token.<br/>
  8) The selected token is annotated with the currently selected weapon range.<br/>

  <p>
  If a target is selected, tiles in your movement range <i>and</i> in range of the target will be highlighted in white, and only tiles on the shortest path to the highlighted squares will remain tinted.<br/>
  If multiple targets are selected, only tiles in range of <i>all</i> targeted enemies will be highlighted. If there's no way to hit all targeted enemies at once, the Overlay will display a warning and act as if no enemies are targeted.
